School is not only a place full of books to learn cultural knowledge, but also a place to carry our youth dreams, but also a place to make friends, confidants and gain friendship. In the eyes of others, maybe I am an excellent student, but I think that the more pretended in my mind may be irreplaceable things that happened in school. And all this is attributed to the laughter and laughter brought by this school.

In the past two years, I have experienced a lot of loneliness and confusion at the beginning, to friendship, from friendship, to laughter and happiness. Indeed, I have experienced a lot in the process... 　　 I hate her. I hate her every time the teacher says something. I, hate her, often my words or actions will make us both fight, and no one can persuade; I love her more, love her funny, love her kindness and tolerance. It is said that feelings are played out, yes, in my opinion, playing around and caring for each other are friends.

I look forward to the end of the epidemic as soon as possible, the opening of school as soon as possible, and the early return to campus.
